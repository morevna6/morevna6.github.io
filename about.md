<p>I am F. Günışığı Aydoğan, an independent researcher in cognitive systems, signal dynamics, and unconventional computation. I explore the intersections of perception, memory, and technological systems—seeking to build tools that reflect both the measurable and the immeasurable aspects of thought and experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My work spans across:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AI architecture and system design</li>
  <li>Cognitive pattern mapping and mental health technologies</li>
  <li>Data validation and workflow automation</li>
  <li>Narrative systems and interactive storytelling</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of my tools are built in Python. Some are built in ideas, signals, and frameworks still taking shape.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This platform is a place to document what I build, why I build it, and what questions I continue to ask along the way.</p>

# Momentum

**Momentum** is a speculative framework exploring memory, perception, and signal resonance.

It investigates how environmental factors and neural states influence perception echoes.  
The project experiments with:
- EEG logging
- Ambient field tracking
- Non-linear time modeling

Momentum seeks to simulate, map, and recreate cognitive signal echoes â€” patterns that linger in consciousness and environment alike.

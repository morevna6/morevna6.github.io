<p><strong>Momentum</strong> is a speculative framework exploring memory, perception, and signal resonance.</p>

<p>It investigates how environmental factors and neural states influence perception echoes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>EEG logging</li>
  <li>Ambient field tracking</li>
  <li>Non-linear time modeling</li>
</ul>

<p>Momentum seeks to simulate, map, and recreate cognitive signal echoes â€” patterns that linger in consciousness and environment alike.</p>

<p>I’m standing at a strange threshold; where one chapter closes, and another demands to be written.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m preparing for my final exams: <strong>Unix System Management</strong> and <strong>Data Types</strong>. These are the final pages of my Associate’s Degree in Computer Programming. A piece of paper to some, survival and rebellion to me. I didn’t get here easily. I carved my way through mental storms, financial collapse, systemic neglect, and the shadows of my own past. I carried a thousand weights just to sit in these classrooms, just to earn the right to build a future.</p>

<p>I’ve never had the luxury of following a straight path. But I always had will. That will became code. It became logic, structure, systems. Somewhere along the way, programming stopped being just a skill; it became a language I used to rebuild myself, line by line.</p>

<p>Now, while finishing school, I’m actively applying for jobs. But not just any job; I’m seeking places that reflect who I am and who I’m becoming. I’m looking for roles that honor the balance of soul and system. Where tech isn’t a factory, but a forge; where I can grow, contribute, and help shape something worth keeping.</p>

<p>In parallel, I’m expanding my knowledge through self-driven learning. I'm pursuing certificate programs, exploring AI, cognition, and the intersections of ethical design and emotional impact. These aren't side quests; they're part of a bigger vision. I believe in tech that heals, tech that empowers, tech that questions what came before and dares to create something better.</p>

<p>Some of that vision is already taking form.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Starwoven</strong> – an interactive story written in Python, helping players process loss, identity, and transformation.</li>
  <li><strong>Solace System</strong> – an AI-supported ecosystem to organize, validate, and preserve knowledge through structured logic and clarity.</li>
  <li><strong>Momentum</strong> – a cognitive research initiative exploring perception, brainwave echoes, and light as a medium of signal decoding.</li>
  <li><strong>Paths of Destiny</strong> – a mythic narrative unfolding as both a literary saga and a planned interactive game, reflecting power, survival, and fate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these projects holds a piece of me; what I’ve been through, what I’ve questioned, what I long to create. They weren’t built for prestige. They were built to survive. To understand. To speak in the languages that silence never could.</p>

<p>And yes; life hasn’t been gentle. I’ve been silenced, scapegoated, doubted, and left to rebuild from the ground up. But I never stayed down. I taught myself how to rise. I didn’t do it with a safety net. I did it with grit, with integrity, and with the stubborn fire of someone who refuses to let the world define their worth.</p>

<p>Some days, all I had was the belief that I could learn. That I could build. That somewhere, there would be a door, or that I’d carve one out of the wall if I had to.</p>

<p>This post isn’t a celebration. It’s a marker. A declaration. A quiet timestamp in the storm to say: I’m still here. I’m still building. I’m not done yet.</p>

<p>I have roots in pain, but I’m growing wings in knowledge. One doesn’t cancel the other; they coexist. And from that tension, I create.</p>

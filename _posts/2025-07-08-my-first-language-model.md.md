<h2>Started Working on My First Language Model</h2>
<hr>

<p>Today marks the beginning of a journey I’ve been dreaming about for a long time; I’ve officially started working on my first <strong>language model from scratch</strong>.</p>

<p>Rather than jumping straight into large-scale architectures like transformers, I’m starting at the very core: building and understanding the foundations step by step. My plan is to begin with simple <strong>N-gram models</strong>, then progress through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tokenization & preprocessing</li>
  <li>Probability-based language generation</li>
  <li>Markov chains</li>
  <li>And eventually deeper NLP concepts</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why?</strong> Because I don’t just want to use AI models. I want to understand how they work, what makes them "think," and how language itself is mathematically modeled. I want to build something from the ground up and learn every piece along the way.</p>

<p>I’ll be documenting my progress, struggles, and breakthroughs here; sharing both code snippets and the thought process behind them. This isn't just about building a model, but about creating a learning journey in public.</p>

<p><strong>Tech stack:</strong> Python, Numpy, and whatever else I need along the way.<br>
<strong>Next step:</strong> Finish my basic N-gram model and generate my first sentences (however broken they may be!).</p>

<p>Stay tuned; this is just the start.</p>

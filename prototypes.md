<p>This is where I share experimental tools, conceptual builds, and early frameworks that are still evolving.</p>

<p>These are raw, exploratory projects — unfinished and unconventional, but full of potential.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Current Prototypes</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dupsy (Prototype Stage)</strong> — Intelligent Excel duplicate detection with fuzzy matching and granular export controls.</li>
  <li><strong>Momentum Echo Logger (In Development)</strong> — EEG and environmental signal mapping toolkit for studying perception echoes.</li>
  <li><strong>Solace Admin Tools (Internal Build)</strong> — Data mapping and data validation utilities for cognitive workflow systems.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note:</em> These prototypes may change, evolve, or disappear as they develop into more stable tools.</p>

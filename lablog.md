<h2>Research Log</h2>

<p>Welcome to the Lablog. This is where I document my reflections, signal theories, system design strategies, and thoughts on perception, cognition, and unconventional computation.</p>

<p>Expect a blend of technical notes, philosophical questions, and experimental updates.</p>

<h3><strong>Topics You Might Find Here:</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Signal mapping and cognitive echoes</li>
  <li>AI architecture for mental health technologies</li>
  <li>Ambient field tracking and environmental resonance</li>
  <li>Fair-based data validation systems</li>
  <li>Design patterns for speculative systems</li>
  <li>Personal reflections on learning, struggle, and discovery</li>
</ul>

<p><em>This log evolves as the research progresses.</em></p>

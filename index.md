<em>“Not everything that is felt is visible. Not everything that is real is measurable.”</em>

<p>The personal research platform of F. Günışığı Aydoğan<br>
Computer Programming Student · Independent Systems Researcher</p>

<p>I build systems; functional, cognitive, speculative.</p>

<p>This space is where my tools, code, ideas, and inner questions converge. My work spans from mental health technology to AI architecture, from data validation ecosystems to narrative frameworks shaped by fate and memory. Some of it runs on Python. Some of it runs on fire, dream, and signal.</p>

<p>This is a home for what I build; both what can be measured, and what cannot.</p>

<br>

<h2><strong>Projects</strong></h2>
<hr>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Momentum</strong></h3>
A speculative framework exploring memory, perception, and signal resonance; through EEG logging, ambient field tracking, and non-linear time modeling.
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Dupsy</strong></h3>
A lightweight desktop tool for intelligent Excel duplicate detection, with granular export and similarity-based matching. Built for accuracy, speed, and offline use.
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Solace System</strong></h3>
A data collection and validation infrastructure designed to support real-world workflows in high-integrity environments. Includes dynamic admin panels, SQL tooling, and fair-based data mapping.
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Paths of Destiny</strong></h3>
A multi-layered narrative and game world exploring trauma, resistance, and cosmic inheritance through mythic storytelling and AI-integrated interaction. Where prophecy meets perception.

<h2><strong>What You'll Find Here</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Research Logs</strong>; reflections, signal theories, design strategies, and thoughts on perception</li>
  <li><strong>Project Updates</strong>; technical progress across my tools and systems</li>
  <li><strong>Experimental Blogs</strong>; ideas in transit: partially formed, provocatively real</li>
  <li><strong>Narrative Work</strong>; fragments and expansions from Paths of Destiny and beyond</li>
  <li><strong>Anomalies</strong>; things I can’t define yet, but feel real</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The work is still growing.</em></p>
<p><em>This site is still evolving.</em></p>
<p><em>But the signal is live.</em></p>
<p><em>And the world is already listening.</em></p>
<p><em>Welcome.</em></p>
